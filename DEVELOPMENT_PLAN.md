# Agent Payment Platform - Development Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure and documentation
- ✅ Basic entity definitions
- ✅ Architectural decisions (ADRs)
- ✅ Service implementations (Identity service fully functional)
- ✅ API endpoints (Identity service with full CRUD)
- ✅ Database layer (PostgreSQL with GORM, repository pattern)
- ✅ Event handling
- ❌ Business logic

## Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate Priority)

### 1.1 Fix Project Structure
- [x] Align directory structure with Makefile expectations
- [x] Move services from `cmd/` to `services/` directory
- [x] Create `libs/` directory for shared components
- [x] Update go.mod dependencies

### 1.2 Database Layer
- [x] Create database schemas for entities
- [x] Implement database connection and migration system
- [x] Add repository pattern for data access
- [x] Set up connection pooling and health checks

### 1.3 Core Service Implementation
- [x] Identity Service: Agent registration and authentication
- [x] Consent Service: Consent management and validation
- [x] Risk Service: Basic risk evaluation
- [x] Orchestration Service: Payment workflow coordination

## Phase 2: API Implementation

### 2.1 REST API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement `/v1/agents` POST endpoint
- [ ] Implement `/v1/payments/authorize` POST endpoint
- [ ] Add proper request validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware

### 2.2 Service Communication
- [ ] Set up HTTP client for inter-service communication
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Add request tracing and correlation IDs

## Phase 3: Event System

### 3.1 Kafka Integration
- [x] Set up Kafka producer/consumer clients
- [x] Implement outbox pattern for transactional events
- [ ] Create event schemas (Avro/Proto)
- [ ] Set up dead letter queues

### 3.2 Event Handlers
- [x] Payment authorization events
- [x] Risk evaluation events
- [x] Ledger posting events
- [ ] Compliance check events

## Phase 4: Business Logic

### 4.1 Payment Processing
- [ ] Payment authorization workflow
- [ ] Multi-rail routing (ACH, cards, wires)
- [ ] Consent verification
- [ ] Risk evaluation integration

### 4.2 Ledger System
- [ ] Double-entry bookkeeping
- [ ] Hash chain implementation
- [ ] Balance calculations
- [ ] Audit trail

## Phase 5: Production Readiness

### 5.1 Observability
- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration
- [ ] Metrics collection
- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Health check endpoints

### 5.2 Security
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Security headers

### 5.3 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all services
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Load testing

## Immediate Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. ✅ **Fix Build System**: Update Makefile and directory structure
2. ✅ **Add Dependencies**: Update go.mod with required packages
3. ✅ **Implement Identity Service**: Start with agent registration
4. ✅ **Add Database Layer**: PostgreSQL integration with basic CRUD
5. ✅ **Create Shared Libraries**: Common types, utilities, middleware
6. ✅ **Implement Consent Service**: Consent management and validation
7. ✅ **Implement Risk Service**: Basic risk evaluation
8. ✅ **Implement Orchestration Service**: Payment workflow coordination
9. ✅ **Implement Router Service**: Payment rail routing and execution
10. ✅ **Implement Ledger Service**: Double-entry bookkeeping and balance tracking
